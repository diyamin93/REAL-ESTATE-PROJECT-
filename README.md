🏠 Real Estate Housing Data Analysis
This project explores and analyzes a real estate dataset using Pandas to extract insights about housing features, pricing trends, and location-based patterns. It is intended for data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and possibly preparing data for machine learning models in future steps.


📌 Objectives
Clean and preprocess the dataset using Pandas

Analyze key trends in housing prices and features

Identify outliers and handle missing values

Generate visualizations to interpret the data better (optional)

Group data by location or features for deeper insights


🧪 Example Insights
Average house price by number of bedrooms

Most expensive neighborhoods

Correlation between square footage and price

Year-wise construction trends

📦 Dependencies
pandas

numpy

matplotlib (optional for visualization)

seaborn (optional)

jupyter

📝 Notes
The dataset can be replaced with any similar housing data CSV file.

The project is extendable to machine learning tasks like price prediction or clustering.
